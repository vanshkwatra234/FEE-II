            India, A country of snake charmers and farmer. We often heard these terms from the Britishers <br> who were disgusted even at the mere thought of India. <br>

                I'm talking about Arab rulers like Muhammad Ghori and other cruel and barbaric rulers. Instead of using those scriptures for their own betterment, <br>they destroyed it like dumb fools.

            <br>We have a glorious and proud past about which we know very little because the invaders that invaded India <br>during the medeival age burnt a lot of scriptures and Vedas that would have enlightened the whole world. <br>

                    The earliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years ago. Sedentariness began in South Asia around 7000 BCE;<br> by 4500 BCE, settled life had spread and gradually evolved into the Indus Valley Civilisation, which flourished between 2500 BCE <br> and 1900 BCE in present-day Pakistan and north-western India. Early in the second millennium BCE, <br>persistent drought caused the population of the Indus Valley to scatter from large urban centres to villages. <br>Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration. <br>The Vedic Period of the Vedic people in northern India (1500–500 BCE) was marked by the composition <br>of their extensive collections of hymns (Vedas). The social structure was loosely stratified via the varna system, <br> incorporated into the highly evolved present-day Jāti system. The pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab <br>into the Gangetic plain. Around 600 BCE, a new, interregional culture arose; then, small chieftaincies (janapadas) were <br> consolidated into larger states (mahajanapadas). Second urbanization took place, which came with the rise of new ascetic <br> movements and religious concepts, including the rise of Jainism and Buddhism. The latter was synthesized with the preexisting <br>religious cultures of the subcontinent, giving rise to Hinduism.

                        Chandragupta Maurya overthrew the Nanda Empire and established the first great empire in ancient India, the Maurya Empire. <br>India's Mauryan king Ashoka is widely recognised for his historical acceptance of Buddhism and his attempts to spread nonviolence <br>and peace across his empire. The Maurya Empire would collapse in 185 BCE, on the assassination of the then-emperor Brihadratha <br>by his general Pushyamitra Shunga. Shunga would form the Shunga Empire in the north and north-east of the subcontinent, while the <br>Greco-Bactrian Kingdom would claim the north-west and found the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties, <br>including the Gupta Empire, in the 4th to 6th centuries CE. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence is known as the Classical or Golden Age of India. <br> Aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion spread to much of Asia, which led to the establishment of Indianised <br>kingdoms in the region, forming Greater India.The most significant event between the 7th and 11th centuries was the Tripartite <br>struggle centred on Kannauj. Southern India saw the rise of multiple imperial powers from the middle of the fifth century. <br>The Chola dynasty conquered southern India in the 11th century. In the early medieval period, Indian mathematics, including Hindu numerals, <br> influenced the development of mathematics and astronomy in the Arab world, including the creation of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system. <br>
    
    Islamic conquests made limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Sindh as early as the 8th century,[7] followed by the invasions of Mahmud Ghazni. <br> The Delhi Sultanate was founded in 1206 CE by Central Asian Turks who were Indianized. They ruled a major part of the northern Indian subcontinent <br>in the early 14th century. It was ruled by Multiple Turk, Afghan and Indian dynasties, Including the Turco-Mongol Indianized Tughlaq Dynasty <br>but declined in the late 14th century following the invasions of Timur[14] and saw the advent of the Deccan sultanates.[15] The wealthy Bengal Sultanate <br> also emerged as a major power, lasting over three centuries.[16] During this period, multiple strong Hindu kingdoms, notably the Vijayanagara Empire <br> and the Rajput states, emerged and played significant roles in shaping the cultural and political landscape of India.
